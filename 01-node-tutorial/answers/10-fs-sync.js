//10-fs-sync.js: This should load writeFileSync and readFileSync functions from the fs module. 
//Then you will use writeFileSync to write 3 lines to a file, ./temporary/fileA.txt, using the "append" flag for each line after the first one. 
//Then use readFileSync to read the file, and log the contents to the console. Be sure you create the file in the temporary directory. 
//That will ensure that it isnâ€™t pushed to Github when you submit your answers (because that file has been added to the .gitignore file for you already which tells git not to look at those files).
