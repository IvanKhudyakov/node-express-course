//Now write a middleware function called auth. This checks for req.cookies.name. If that cookie is present, it sets req.user to the value, and calls next.

//Now add an app.post("/logon"), which should require a name in the body. 
//If it is present, it should do a res.cookie("name", req.body.name), and send back a 201 result code plus a message that says hello to the user. 
//If name is not present, it should return a 400 and an error message in JSON.
